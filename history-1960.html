                On Tuesday March 8th 1960 at 05:10 the Plassy ran aground at Finnis Rock. She was 
                travelling from Fenit, County Kerry to Galway City while a southeasterly
                gale force 9 to storm force 10 was blowing. Poor visibilty and driving winds forced 
                her off course and she ran aground on the limestone shallows at Finnis Rock 
                (ironically pronounced 'finish' in Irish).
            </p>

                A crew member, Eddie Reidy recounts the fatal moment. “We were coming along the lee 
                of the land. I was on the 4 to 8 watch and in the galley making tea and toast. Next 
                thing, Wallop, such a thump. We hit it so hard. I was taken off the deck and hit the 
                ceiling. Water started to rush in from underneath. There was shouting and running in 
                all directions.”
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-arriving.webp">           
            <p>
                An attempt was made to abandon ship using the starboard lifeboat but the sea was so 
                heavy that it was deemed too dangerous and the captain ordered the crew back on board 
                to wait to be rescued. Luckily the disaster was spotted by an islander and the onshore 
                rescue unit were quickly contacted.

                However it took about an hour for the rescue unit to cover the 3 km from the rocket
                house to the rescue site due to the poor roads and lack of transport vehicles. The 
                equipment had to be carried by hand over the limestone and rocks for the last kilometer.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-assembling-apparthus.webp">
            <p>
                Once the rescue unit arrived at the site the equipment had to be unloaded from its container 
                and assembled. The team quickly set up the 'apparathus' as it was called and proceeded to 
                launch the rocket into the wind as this would ensure better accuracy. 
            </p>
           <img src="assets/img/rescue-rocket-fired.webp">
            <p>
                Two attempts failed to hit the target due to the extremely adverse conditions of driving wind, 
                rain and swirling sand from the nearby beach. Finally the third and last remaining shot 
                miraculously hit the rear mast. The Plassy crew secured  the line to the mast to get ready for the rescue.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-line-attached.webp"> 
            <p>
                The onshore rescue unit secured their side of the cables, attached the 
                'breeches buoy', and began the slow process getting all the crew off the ship.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-securing-line.webp">
            <p>  
              Getting the care off the ship safely was a hazard in its own right. Due to the weight of the 
              crewmen being rescued, the impossibilty of keeping the cables taut in the prevailing conditions
              and the mountaineous waves, the men being rescued were pulled underwater as often as they were 
              above the water. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-preparing-to-pull.webp">
            <p>
              Later it was jokingly said that they almost drowned twice. Once while being pulled ashore and later 
              with the gallons of whiskey given to warm them up after the ordeal.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-last-survivor.webp">
            <p>
              Finally the last of the plassey crew wer brought ashore and the rescue unit and ships crew made their 
              way over the rough ground to warmth and safety. The Inisheer Rescue Team consisted of 19 men all of and
              all but one (due to illness) were on hand that day to assist with the rescue. In total over 65 islanders 
              turned up to lend a hand in any way they could. The onshore rescue unit were Martin O'Donnell (Michael, Lurgan), 
              Edward Flaherty (Patrick, Formna), Coleman Conneely (Morgan, West), Patrick Conneely (Martin, Formna), 
              Martin Flaherty (Edward, Formna), Patrick Conneely (Patrick, West), Sean Sharry (Michael, West), Martin 
              Conneely (John, Chapel), Patrick Griffin (Michael, West), Martin Sharry (Michael, West), Martin Folan
              (Patrick, Lurgan), Patrick Conneely (Coleman, Chapel), Thomas Costelloe (Martin, Chapel), Patrick Conneely
              (C.I.E, West), Michael O'Donnell (Patrick, West), Andrew Conneely (Martin, Lurgan), Edward Conneely (Martin,
              Lurgan), Michael Conneely (Peter, West), Roger Conneely (Sean, Lurgan).

              The Plassey remained aground on the Finnis rock for some time until a subsequent storm washed her ashore and
              pushed her up to the high tide mark. Such is the power of the atlantic sea off the coast of Inisheer. Today 
              there is a buoy on the Finnis Rock as a beacon to warn ships. It lights up with 3 quick flashes every 10 seconds. 
              By day it is identified by its black yellow black paintwork.

          The Plassy remained stranded on Finnis Rock for some time before a subsequent storm drove her high on to the rocks. 
          Harold Strong visisted the island in 1962 and took these fantastic photographs. She was still in good shape at this 
          time but the following years would see further damage by the sea and general decay as she rusts away.

        <h2>The Plassy Today</h2>
        <p>         
          The years since have heaped further storms on the Plassy driving her further inland and pulverizing her in the process.
          Tourists visiting Inisheer mark her down as a must see on their itinerary and every year brings more and more to see
          her and leard about the history. Nearly all the crew and onshore rescue team have passed away by now but the Plassy is 
          still on Inisheer as a reminder of their bravery and exploits on that fateful day of March 8th 1960.
