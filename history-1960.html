      <h2>Plassey rescue</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="origin-intro">
      <p>
        On Tuesday March 8th 1960 at 05:10 the Plassy ran aground at Finnis Rock. She was
        travelling from Fenit, County Kerry to Galway City while a southeasterly
        gale force 9 to storm force 10 was blowing. Poor visibilty and driving winds forced
        her off course and she ran aground on the limestone shallows at Finnis Rock
        (ironically pronounced 'finish' in Irish).
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-aftermath.webp" alt="plassey photograph after rescue">
      <p>
        A crew member, Eddie Reidy recounts the fatal moment. “We were coming along the lee
        of the land. I was on the 4 to 8 watch and in the galley making tea and toast. Next
        thing, Wallop, such a thump. We hit it so hard. I was taken off the deck and hit the
        ceiling. Water started to rush in from underneath. There was shouting and running in
        all directions.”
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-arriving.webp" alt="onshore rescue crew arriving onsite">
      <p>
        An attempt was made to abandon ship using the starboard lifeboat but the sea was so
        heavy that it was deemed too dangerous and the captain ordered the crew back on board
        to wait to be rescued. Luckily the disaster was spotted by an islander and the onshore
        rescue unit were quickly contacted.

        However it took about an hour for the rescue unit to cover the 3 km from the rocket
        house to the rescue site due to the poor roads and lack of transport vehicles. The
        equipment had to be carried by hand over the limestone and rocks for the last kilometer.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-assembling-apparthus.webp" alt="rescue crew assempling 'rocket' apparathus">
      <p>
        Once the rescue unit arrived at the site the equipment had to be unloaded from its container
        and assembled. The team quickly set up the 'apparathus' as it was called and proceeded to
        launch the rocket into the wind which would ensure better accuracy.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-rocket-fired.webp" alt="final attempt of rocket firing">
      <p>
        Two attempts failed to hit the target due to the extremely adverse conditions of driving wind,
        rain and swirling sand from the nearby beach. Finally the third and last remaining shot
        miraculously hit the rear mast. The Plassy crew secured the line to the mast to get ready for the rescue.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-line-attached.webp" alt="rescue cable attached to stern mast">
      <p>
        The onshore rescue unit secured their side of the cables, attached the
        'breeches buoy', and began the slow process getting all the crew off the ship.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-securing-line.webp" alt="rescue crew securing csble onshore">
      <p>
        Getting the care off the ship safely was a hazard in its own right. Due to the weight of the
        crewmen being rescued, the impossibilty of keeping the cables taut in the prevailing conditions
        and the mountaineous waves, the men being rescued were pulled underwater as often as they were
        above the water.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-preparing-to-pull.webp" alt="rescue crew pulling ship crew member">
      <p>
        Later it was jokingly said that they almost drowned twice. Once while being pulled ashore and later
        with the gallons of whiskey given to warm them up after the ordeal.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/rescue-last-survivor.webp" alt="final crew member pulled ashore">
      <p>
        Finally the last of the plassey crew were brought ashore and the rescue unit and ships crew made their
        way over the rough ground to warmth and safety. The Inisheer Onshore Rescue Unit consisted of 19 men
        all but one (due to illness) of which were on hand that day to assist with the rescue. In total over 65 
        islandersturned up to lend a hand in any way they could. The onshore rescue unit were Martin O'Donnell 
        (Michael, Lurgan), Edward Flaherty (Patrick, Formna), Coleman Conneely (Morgan, West), Patrick Conneely 
        (Martin, Formna), Martin Flaherty (Edward, Formna), Patrick Conneely (Patrick, West), Sean Sharry (Michael, 
        West), Martin Conneely (John, Chapel), Patrick Griffin (Michael, West), Martin Sharry (Michael, West), 
        Martin Folan (Patrick, Lurgan), Patrick Conneely (Coleman, Chapel), Thomas Costelloe (Martin, Chapel), 
        Patrick Conneely (C.I.E, West), Michael O'Donnell (Patrick, West), Andrew Conneely (Martin, Lurgan), Edward 
        Conneely (Martin, Lurgan), Michael Conneely (Peter, West), Roger Conneely (Sean, Lurgan).

      <p>
        The Plassey remained stranded on the Finnis rock for some time until a subsequent storm washed her ashore and
        pushed her up to the high tide mark. Such is the power of the atlantic sea off the coast of Inisheer. Today
        there is a buoy on the Finnis Rock as a beacon to warn ships. It lights up with 3 quick flashes every 10 seconds.
        By day it is identified by its black yellow black paintwork.

        The Plassy remained stranded on Finnis Rock for some time before a subsequent storm drove her high on to the rocks.
        Harold Strong visisted the island in 1962 and took these fantastic photographs. She was still in reasonable shape at this
        time but the following years would see further damage by the sea and general decay as she rusts away.

      The years since have heaped further storms on the Plassy driving her further inland and pulverizing her in the process.
      Tourists visiting Inisheer mark her down as a must see on their itinerary and every year brings more and more to see
      her and leard about the history. Nearly all the crew and onshore rescue team have passed away by now but the Plassy is
      still on Inisheer as a reminder of their bravery on that fateful day of March 8th 1960.
