                On Tuesday March 8th 1960 at 05:10 the Plassy ran aground at Finis Rock.She was 
                travelling from Fenit, County Kerry to Galway City while a southeasterly
                gale force 9 to storm force 10 was blowing. Poor visibilty and driving winds forced 
                her off course and she ran aground on the limestone shallows at Finis Rock 
                (ironically pronounced 'finish' in Irish).
            </p>

                A crew member, Eddie Reidy recounts the fatal moment. “We were coming along the lee 
                of the land. I was on the 4 to 8 watch and in the galley making tea and toast. Next 
                thing, Wallop, such a thump. We hit it so hard. I was taken off the deck and hit the 
                ceiling. Water started to rush in from underneath. There was shouting and running in 
                all directions.”
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-arriving.webp">           
            <p>
                An attempt was made to abandon ship using the starboard lifeboat but the sea was so 
                heavy that it was deemed too dangerous and the captain ordered the crew back on board 
                to wait to be rescued. Luckily the disaster was spotted by an islander and the island 
                rescue team were quickly contacted.

                However it took about an hour for the rescue team to cover the 3 km from the rocket
                house to the rescue site due to the poor roads and lack of transport vehicles. The 
                equipment had to be carried by hand over the limestone and rocks for the last kilometer.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-assembling-apparthus.webp">
            <p>
                Once the rescue team arrived at the site the equipment had to be unloaded from its container 
                and assembled. The team quickly set up the 'apparathus' as it was called and proceeded to 
                launch the rocket into the wind as this would ensure better accuracy. 
            </p>
           <img src="assets/img/rescue-rocket-fired.webp">
            <p>
                Two attempts failed to hit the target due to the extremely adverse conditions of driving wind, 
                rain and swirling sand from the nearby beach. Finally the third and last remaining shot 
                miraculously hit the rear mast. The Plassy crew secured  the line to the mast to get ready for the rescue.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-line-attached.webp"> 
            <p>
                The onshore rescue team secured their side of the cables, attached the 
                'breeches buoy', and began the slow process getting all the crew off the ship.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-securing-line.webp">
            <p>  
              Getting the care off the ship safely was a hazard in its own right. Due to the weight of the 
              crewmen being rescued, the impossibilty of keeping the cables taut in the prevailing conditions
              and the mountaineous waves, the men being rescued were pulled underwater as often as above. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-preparing-to-pull.webp">
            <p>
              Later it was jokingly said that they almost drowned twice. Once while being pulled ashore and later 
              with the gallons of whisky given to warm them up after the ordeal.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/rescue-last-survivor.webp">
            <p>
              Finally the last of the plassey crew wer brought ashore and the rescue team and ships crew made their 
              way over the rough ground to warmth and safety.
            </p>
